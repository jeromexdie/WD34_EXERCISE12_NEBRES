        <h3 class="agent-title">SOVA, THE HUNTER</h3>
        <p id="story-one">
          Sova is the sixth member of the VALORANT PROTOCOL. He comes from
          Russia and uses his archery and hunting skills to gain the upper hand.
        </p>
        <p id="story-two">
          Sova has a very calm and level-headed personality. Although he is
          incredibly dedicated and ruthless towards the enemies, he is warm
          towards his teammates, always encouraging and complimenting them. He
          believes in himself and he believes in his team to win. His steadiness
          and tirelessness on the field is most likely an asset to the morale of
          the team. He is here to protect his Earth; one can only assume that
          his experience with the rifts drives this desire.
        </p>
        <p id="story-three">
          Sova's abilities are most likely linked to his prosthetic eye,
          granting him the sight of a hunter. All of his abilities are based on
          radianite-enhanced technology. Sova also has an Owl Drone, connected
          to his eye, which he can send to scout ahead and reveal enemies in its
          Line of Sight. His primary weapon is a collapsible bow, that can be
          fit with various arrows. In-game, he uses multiple kinds: a Recon
          Bolt, which attaches itself to a surface and reveals any enemies in
          its line of sight, and Shock Darts that do damage on contact. When he
          utilizes Hunter's Fury, he equips his bow with a different kind of
          arrows that seem to be made from pure energy. These arrows can
          penetrate through walls, to do heavy damage and reveal struck targets.
