        <h3 class="agent-title">CHAMBER, THE TWO-FACED MAN</h3>
        <p id="story-one">
          Chamber is a radianite tech user who makes use of a pair of custom
          firearms, nanotechnology, and personal teleportation equipment. His
          general specialty is as both a weapons designer, and as a marksman, as
          before he joined the VALORANT PROTOCOL, he was in the French military,
          worked as a PMC marksman, and later transferred to Kingdom's weapon
          design department. (The black business cards Chamber uses as part of
          his kit read "Vincent Fabon // Chief Weapons Designer / Kingdom
          Defense Program", suggesting he was once lead of the department.)
        </p>
        <p id="story-two">
          Chamber's kit relies on two custom weapons, the intel gathering and
          crowd control ability Trademark and a personal teleportation method.
          His side arm is a Sheriff-like weapon with a gold casing and a scope
          called Headhunter. His main weapon is a high-powered sniper rifle
          named Tour de Force, which may fire radianite charges or bullets as
          evidenced by the UNCOVER FRACTURE trailer where it shows a close-up of
          one of his bullets being fired with the exterior casing falling away
          to reveal a purple crystalline shard inside.
        </p>
        <p id="story-three">
          Both weapons appear to be designed and built by Chamber himself, as a
          blueprint for Tour de Force appears in the video from Chamber's social
          media takeover called L'Art de Vivre. Meanwhile, his personal
          teleportation system allows Chamber to reposition himself through the
          use of small metal cards (shown in Chamber's trailer L'Accord) and
          make use of a unique nanotechnology to allow him to recall both his
          custom weapons to him through the golden tattoos on his arms and neck.
          His intel gathering Ability, Trademark, is a small bot summoned from
          one of his metal cards that can monitor a certain radius and
          destabilizes terrain with a slowing field after detecting an enemy and
          sending a signal to Chamber as an alarm.
